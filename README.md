[ ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mk-5/gdx-fireapp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mk-5/gdx-fireapp) [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/mk-5/maven/gdx-fireapp/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/mk-5/maven/gdx-fireapp/_latestVersion) [_![Coverage](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=mk-5_gdx-fireapp&metric=coverage)_](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=mk-5_gdx-fireapp) 


## Getting Started

The first thing you should do is installing Firebase SDK and add gradle dependencies.   

[Android  guide](https://github.com/mk-5/gdx-fireapp/wiki/Android-guide) - [iOS guide](https://github.com/mk-5/gdx-fireapp/wiki/iOS-Guide) - [HTML guide](https://github.com/mk-5/gdx-fireapp/wiki/GWT-guide) - [ProGuard required rules](https://github.com/mk-5/gdx-fireapp/wiki/Proguard-required-rules)

**Core**

```
implementation "pl.mk5.gdx-fireapp:gdx-fireapp-core:$gdxFireappVersion"
```
**Android**

```
implementation "pl.mk5.gdx-fireapp:gdx-fireapp-android:$gdxFireappVersion"
```
**iOS**

```
implementation "pl.mk5.gdx-fireapp:gdx-fireapp-ios-moe:$gdxFireappVersion"
```

**GWT**

```
implementation "pl.mk5.gdx-fireapp:gdx-fireapp-html:$gdxFireappVersion"
```

&nbsp;

**The latest version** was built using libGDX 1.9.8, multi-os-engine 1.4.3, gwt 2.8.0, iOS firebase sdk 5.x,
android firebase sdk 16.x

&nbsp;

## Basics

API is something like bridge between libGDX app and firebase sdk. It's cover firebase functionality so if you have some knowledge about firebase SDK - using this API should be intuitive for you.

&nbsp;

To initialize Firebase SDK just put this line somewhere in your app initialization code:

```java
GdxFIRApp.inst().configure();
```

**Firebase Analytics** should start working just after this step.

If you added ***Fabric/Crashlytics*** to your project you should initialize it also:

````
GdxFIRCrash.inst().initialize();
````
